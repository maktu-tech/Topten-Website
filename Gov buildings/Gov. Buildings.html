The structure is constructed in style known as Mysore Neo-Dravidian, along with incorporations of Indo-Saracenic and Dravidian styles of architecture. Kengal Hanumanthaiah was the brainchild behind this architectural marvel, whose foundation-a stone-was laid by then then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, in the year 1952 and was officially declared open in the year 1956. The five-storeyed structure is the largest legislative building in the country which is spread across an area of 2,300 ft by 1,1150 ft.

The building measures 150 m in length and stretches itself to a water body known as Lal Dighi, it also holds an important place in the Indian Independence Movement.","The highest judicial forum, Supreme Court, is now open for the general public on Saturdays. The newly instated CJI on Friday had said that the opening of the 'public institution' is experiment, a very limited exposure to the Supreme Court, a public institution that I thought should be opened up in a limited way. They also launched a portal, through which one can book ‘guided tours’ to the Supreme Court. The guided tour is a great opportunity to gain inside access to the grand interiors of the Supreme Court building and admire the majestic structure in its full glory. During the guided tour, the visitors will be accompanied throughout the premises and introduced to parts of historical importance. The Supreme Court of India is open to the general public from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM every Saturday except on declared holidays. The tour is expected to be an hour long where an official of the Court will be assigned as your tour guide who will elaborate upon the structure of the Indian legal system and will also give intriguing examples of decided cases and the historical significance behind the architecture of the building.","The seat of administration of the government of Kerala, the secretariat is the office of important ministers and bureaucrats.

The first one is located in Dehradun and the second one in Nainital. During the pre-independence time, Nainital was the summer capital of the United Provinces which is the present Uttar Pradesh. Built on the lines of a Scottish castle, it was named as Government House and was renamed as Raj Bhavan after Independence. The structure is the only Raj Bhavan which is open for tourists unlike the other, where entry is restricted.","Located at the end of the Sansad Marg, the Parliament House or Sansad Bhavan is one of the most impressive buildings in New Delhi. The Parliament House comprises of a central hall which is circular in shape and is considered to be very important part of the building since this is the place where the Indian Constitution was drafted. The Parliament houses the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and a library hall. There lies a garden in between three chambers.

Built in the 1910s, it is home to some of the most important ministries of theCabinet of India. Situated on Raisina Hill, New Delhi, the Secretariat buildings are two blocks of symmetrical buildings (North Block and South Block) on opposite sides of the great axis of Rajpath, and flanking The Rashtrapati Bhavan (President’s House). Both the identical building have four levels, each with about 1,000 rooms, in the inner courtyards to make space for future expansions. In continuation with the Viceroy’s House, these buildings also used cream and red Dholpur sandstone from Rajasthan, with the red sandstone forming the base. Together the buildings were designed to form two squares. They have broad corridors between different wings and wide stairways to the four floors and each building is topped by a giant dome, while each wings end with colonnaded balcony. These are visible in the use of Jali, perforated screens, to protect from scorching sun and monsoon rains of India. Another feature of the building is a dome-like structure known as the Chatri, a design unique to India, used in ancient times to give relief to travelers by providing shade from the hot Indian sun.","Earlier known as Sachivalaya, Mantralaya is the administrative headquarters of the state government of Maharashtra. Located in South Mumbai near Nariman Point, the building was built in 1955 and is one of the most prominent landmarks of the city. The Parliment building is a seven storeyed building housing most of the departments of the state government. Officials like the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister sit on the sixth floor and the Chief Secretary on the fifth floor. There is also a new building constructed due to the increasing number of departments and staff. The building stands opposite Mantralaya and contains 13 floors.

In 1957, the Mysore government planned to replace the inscription with Satyameva Jayate, at a cost of 7,500 rupees, but the change did not take place. In 1996, the inscription inspired a visiting U.S. state governor, George Voinovich of Ohio, to propose etching 'With God, all things are possible' onto the Ohio Statehouse, prompting a high-profile lawsuit.","Writers' acquired its Greco-Roman look, complete with the portico in the central bay and the red surface of exposed brick.

In the post-Independence period, Sarojini Naidu, the first Governor of Uttar Pradesh, was the first occupant of this historic monument.","A new Parliament building may replace the existing complex. The new building is being considered on account of the stability concerns regarding the current complex. A committee to suggest few alternatives to the current building has been set up by the ex-Speaker, Meira Kumar. The present building, an 85-year-old structure suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues. The building also needs to be protected because of its heritage tag.","The vestiges of the colonial High Court continue to characterise the premises till date. In a rare tradition which is today a distinction, Judges of the Madras High Court are still led by orderlies who bear a ceremonial mace made of silver. This is a practice so old and Anglican that most High Courts and even the Supreme Court of India have either not had the practice at all or have abandoned it long back.","The Secretariat Building was designed by the prominent British architect Herbert Baker in Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture. Both the identical buildings have four levels, each with about 1,000 rooms, in the inner courtyards to make space for future expansions.
