        var body_about_2=["The airport was operated by the Indian Air Force before its management was transferred to the Airports Authority of India. In May 2006, the management of the airport was passed over to Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), a consortium led by the GMR Group. In September 2008, the airport inaugurated a 4,430 m (14,530 ft) runway. With the commencement of operations at Terminal 3 in 2010, it became India's and South Asia's largest aviation hub.

The new integrated terminal T2 was inaugurated on 10 January 2014 and opened for international operations on 12 February 2014. A dedicated six lane, elevated road connecting the new terminal with the main arterial Western Express Highway was also opened to the public the same day. The airport is named after the 17th-century Maratha warrior king, having been renamed in 1999 from the previous 'Sahar Airport' to 'Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport' (the title 'Maharaj' was inserted on August 30, 2018). CSIA's IATA airport code – 'BOM' – is derived from Bombay, Mumbai former name. It is situated across the suburbs of Santacruz, Vile Parle and Sahar village in Andheri.","Chennai was one of the first airports in India. The airport was built on land donated by the former governor of Madras Presidency, K Sriramulu Naidu. Although the first aircraft 'de Havilland' landed in Chennai Airport in 1932, the usage was confined only to military operations during World War II. In 1952, the Civil Aviation Department took over its operations followed by the AAI in 1972. Chennai airport in 2017 An air cargo complex was commissioned on 1 February 1978 for processing of import, export, and transshipment cargo, in addition to unaccompanied luggage, which is the second gateway air cargo terminal in the country after the one at Kolkata airport. The first terminal was built at the north-east side of the airport in the suburb of Meenambakkam, thus being referred to as Meenambakkam Airport. Another terminal was built at Tirusulam where passenger operations were shifted.In 2001, Chennai Airport received ISO 9001-2000 certification, the first such international airport in India. During the early days, Madras Airport was one of the largest airports in India handling many international flight connections In 2008, the AAI started major modernisation of the airport","The airport operates three passenger terminals and one cargo terminal. With over 1.6 million sq ft in area, the airport's Terminal 3 is one of the largest terminals in India. On 18 August 2015, Cochin International Airport became the world's first fully solar powered airport with the inauguration of a dedicated solar plant. On 26 July 2018, the airport was selected for the coveted Champion of the Earth award, the highest environmental honour instituted by the United Nations. After Indian Independence, the Indian Navy operated the airport, though it permitted civilian aircraft to use the facility. The Gulf economic boom of the 1980s made it necessary to develop international transportation to Kochi in the interests of expatriates working in the Middle East.","The first flight to the airport, Air India Flight 609 from Mumbai, was allowed to land the previous night as it would be continuing to Singapore shortly after midnight. The aircraft touched down at 10:40 pm on 23 May. The airport became the third greenfield airport under a public–private partnership to open in India, after Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad and Cochin International Airport. Kempegowda Airport has three cargo terminals. BIAL inaugurated a separate cargo village in December 2008. The village is spread over 11 acres (4.5 ha) and includes office space, conference rooms, a cafeteria for staff and parking space for nearly 80 trucks. It did not open for occupation until 2010 and initially suffered low occupancy, which some cargo agents attributed to the opening delay, high rent and limited infrastructure.","The existing commercial airport, Begumpet Airport, was unable to handle rising passenger traffic. The State Government initially considered converting Hakimpet Air Force Station to civilian use however, the Air Force refused. When the State proposed the construction of a new airport for the Air Force, the Ministry of Defence suggested the State consider sites south of Begumpet Airport. By October 1998, the State had narrowed down to three possible locations for the new airport: Bongloor, Nadergul and Shamshabad. Due to its convenient location near two highways (NH 44 and NH 765) and a railway line, Shamshabad was selected in December 1998.","The airport was built, in 1955, by the Government of the Estado da Índia Portuguesa, on 249 acres of land, as the Aeroporto de Dabolim, which was later officially renamed to Aeroporto General Bénard Guedes. Until 1961, the airport served as the main hub of the Portuguese India's airline TAIP, which on a regular schedule served Daman, Diu, Karachi, Mozambique, Portuguese Timor, and other destinations. During the Indian annexation of Goa, in December 1961, the airport was bombarded by the Indian Air Force with parts of the infrastructure being destroyed. Two civilian planes that were in the airport – a Lockheed Constellation from TAP (Portuguese International Airlines) and a Douglas DC-4 from TAIP – managed to escape with refugees, during the night, to Karachi.","Kolkata airport traditionally served as a strategic stopover on the air route from Europe to Indochina and Australia. Many pioneering flights passed through the airport, including Amelia Earhart's in 1937. In 1924, KLM began scheduled stops at Calcutta, as part of their Amsterdam to Batavia (Jakarta) route. The same year, a Royal Air Force aircraft landed in Calcutta as part of the first round-the-world expedition by any air force. Commercial operations were intended to start on 23 January 2013, the 116th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. However, the shift to the new terminal was only completed on 16 March.","The airport currently consists of four terminals: domestic, international, an additional terminal for secondary traffic and a cargo terminal as well. The airport has 45 parking bays and both the international and domestic terminals have four aero-bridges each. The new terminal has been modelled based on Singapore Changi Airport. The new terminal has a half-kilometre-long moving walkway, which connects the two terminals. Airports Authority of India (AAI) will construct a new technical block which will enhance the flight handling capacity and provide better control of flights.","Lohegaon air force station serves as an international airport for the city. Due to restricted traffic, only two to four international flights can operate from the airport. Moreover, it is an Air Force base and has a single civil terminal which operates both international as well as domestic traffic. Almost 65 to 70 flights operate connecting major domestic destinations. This is crowding the existing airport and leading to delay of flights as the airport has only eight parking bays out of which one is used for VIP's and other is used for charter operations and the remaining carry the load of international as well as domestic flights. Hence, this led to the need for a dedicated international airport for the city as the city is one of the fastest growing cities in India and is included in the Smart City program of the Indian government."];

It will be an extension of the Gottigere-Nagawara line. A high-speed rail link was previously considered and went as far as obtaining approval from the Union Government. However, the project was eventually scrapped because of high costs and the lack of stops along the line.","Under the second phase of the Hyderabad Metro Rail project, a 30-kilometre (19 mi) rail link between Raidurg/Gachibowli and RGIA will be constructed. As of late 2015, feasibility studies on the phase are underway. The closest Indian Railways station is Umdanagar.","Indian Railways connects Goa with direct train services from Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Mangalore, Kochi, Kolkata, Thiruvanantapuram, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad. The destination station is usually Madgaon in South Goa, one can also choose to get down at Thivim in North Goa. Travelling to Goa by train is a real pleasure as the route passes through greenery and many tunnels.

The four-kilometre-long elevated track connected the airport's Biman Bandar station with Dum Dum Cantonment railway station, passing Jessore Road. Electric multiple unit rolling stock served the line. However, due to poor patronage and plans to replace it with a metro system, the railway line closed in September 2016 to facilitate construction of the metro lines between Noapara and Barasat via the airport, and New Garia to the airport.","The total straight line distance between Ahmedabad Airport and Ahmedabad Railway Station is 5 KM (kilometers) and 800 meters.

It was launched in December 2012 to replace GMR's Aero Express service.","There are several bus routes from various cities, but most traffic is from mainly Mumbai and Pune. Due to increasing demand from the south, there has been an increase in buses and trains from Mangalore and Bangalore. Overnight buses from Mumbai to Goa are an alternative to trains and flying. Book in advance during the crowded seasons. Kadamba Transport Corporation is the Goa state-run transport service. Its buses have seen better days, and more efficient times. There are also other state-run buses run by the governments of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. Many private players also offer bus connections to other cities, with varying levels of discounts and efficiency, with the two usually being inversely related.","The airport has a well established facility of prepaid taxis and air-conditioned buses connecting it to the city center. As part of the larger modernisation programme, a flyover at Nagerbazar and an entry ramp on VIP Road have also been constructed. A 2 km flyover from Kestopur to Raghunathpur (near Tegharia) was built to speed up airport-bound traffic. These reduce journey times to the airport. Parking facilities at the new terminal include two underground parking levels accommodating 3000 cars, as well as an outdoor carpark which can handle an additional 2000 cars.","AMTS buses serve the airport through the stops of Airport Circle or Sardarnagar Approach almost 1 km from the airport on the 'Airport Road'."," The proposed airport will be connected with six different routes including national highways 48 and 65. There will also be a special ring-road connecting major industrial establishments with the proposed airport from Hadapsar."];

        <p id='info1'>An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control tower.An international airport has additional facilities for customs and passport control as well as incorporating all of the aforementioned elements. An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport. Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control tower. An airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals. Larger airports may have airport aprons, taxiway bridges, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and lounges, and emergency services. In some countries, the US in particular, they also typically have one or more fixed-base operators, serving general aviation.Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies with 15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area being airport terminals</p>
