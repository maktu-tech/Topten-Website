        <p id="head1">Welcome to Forts:</p>
        <p id='info1'>Most of the forts in India are actually castles or fortresses. But when the British Government in India were cataloging them in the 17th–19th century they used the word forts as it was common in Britain then. All fortifications whether European or Indian were termed forts. Thereafter this became the common usage in India. In local languages, the fort names are suffixed by local word for fort thus usage of the Sanskrit word durga, or Hindi word qila or the word garh or gad in Rajasthan,and Maharashtra is common. For example, Suvarnadurg, Mehrangarh, Sudhagad etc.</p>
        <p id="head2">Few Renowed Forts:</p>
